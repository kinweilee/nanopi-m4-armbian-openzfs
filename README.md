# nanopi-m4-armbian-openzfs WIP!
Instructions to help you setup a ZFS root file system with RAIDZ1 on a nanopi-m4 with 4 port SATA hat
## Requirements
- nanopi m4
- 4xSATA hata
- Armbian installation with bullseye 5.15.x kernel
## Aim
This installation stores the SPL, u-boot and initramfs files on the SD card and while the root filesystem is stored on the raid drive. U-boot and initramfs will be configured to bypass the root file system on the SD card and to load from the zpool dataset root file system.

## Quick Overview of Installation Steps
- Build Armbian from source - since current versions of Armbian didn't seem to support SD card boot for my NanoPi M4.
- Install necessary ZFS packages
- Setup RAIDZ drives rpool a MIRROR could also be used
- Modify initramfs modules to load and rebuild initramfs
- Update initramfs
- Modify armbianENV.txt to use bootargs (extraargs) to boot from ZFS ROOT with  
- Copy root file system from SD card to zpool dataset using rsync
- Reboot

# The details
## The Boot Process
Before starting it is useful to describe the boot process of this NanoPi M4. After a hardware reset the boot ROM loads a SPL boot loader (secondary program loader - a stripped down version of u-boot) from the SD card, memory is configured and then u-boot is started in full. U-boot then loads the kernel and (in this case) the initial RAM disk initramfs, and then transfers control the kernel.

## Compiling Armbian
Download build Armbian using the [Armbian Build Documentation](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Build-Preparation/).


## ZFS setup
### Installing ZFS packages
```
apt install -t bullseye-backports zfs-dkms zfsutils-linux zfs-initramfs 
``` 
### Pool Creation

#### Disk Identification
Identify the four disks to be using in the RAIDZ-1 array, using the ata-[disk_X] generated by the following command.
```
ls -lh /dev/disk/by-id/
```

#### Creating the pool
We will creat a zfs pool called rpool
```
zpool create -f \
-o ashift=12 \
-O acltype=posixacl -O canmount=off -O compression=lz4 \
-O dnodesize=auto -O normalization=formD -O relatime=on \
-O xattr=sa -O mountpoint=/ -R / \
rpool raidz  /dev/disk/by-id/ata-[disk_1] /dev/disk/by-id/ata-[disk_2] /dev/disk/by-id/ata-[disk_3] /dev/disk/by-id/ata-[disk_4]
```

We will create two datasets with the second being the future root file system, initially it will be mount in /mnt, later this will be changed to '/'. 

#### Creating the datasets
```
zfs create -o mountpoint=none rpool/ROOT
zfs create -o mountpoint=/mnt rpool/ROOT/debian-1 
```
It is possible to use the /dev/sdX format however it is not recommended as these names can change when SATA cables are swapped. However swapping formats between /dev/sdX to /dev/disk/by-id/ can be easily be performed by the following commands
```
zpool export zfspool
zpool import -d /dev/disk/by-id -aN
```

## Root File System Setup
### Copying SD card file system to the zpool dataset
Make sure the pool is mounted to /mnt with ```zfs list```

The following rsync command copies the files from the existing SD card file system to /mnt. 
```
rsync -aAXv / --exclude={/dev/*,/proc/*,/sys/*,/tmp/*,/run/*,/mnt/*,/media/*,/lost+found} /mnt
  
```

### Modify fstab
The file system table (fstab) does not need the SD card entry and should be commented out. The ZFS module automatically loads the zpool information from zpool.cache and mounts the disk so an entry in /fstab is not needed.


## Change zpool Mount Point
At the moment the ZFS pool is mounted to /mnt for convenience during the setup stage, however in the final setup the rpool/ROOT/debian-1 will need to be mounted as '/'
```
zfs set mountpoint=/ rpool/ROOT/debian-1
```

## Update initramfs 
add zfs to the modules to be loaded by initramfs and ensure the /etc/zpool.cache exists, this is generated using the zpool export rpool command.
```
echo zfs >> /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
```
Update the initramfs 
```
zpool export rpool
update-initramfs -u
```

## Changes to ArmbianEnv.txt
Comment out, rootdev, rootfstype and add extraargs
```` 
...
#rootdev=UUID=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
#rootfstype=ext
...
extraargs=root=rpool/ROOT/debian-1 boot=zfs
```
During the initramfs boot the kernel will use the 'extraargs' for root and boot supplied by armbianEnv.txt. Adding the parameters with 'extraargs' into armbianEnv.txt means that boot.scr doesn't need to be recreated.

## Reboot

## Post Install
remember SD card needs to be mounted
any changes to initramfs need to be copied to the SD card
/boot that is used by u-boot is not on the raid drive

## Troubleshooting
### Stuck in initramfs - Manual booting zfs pool
If the boot process stops here it is most likely the zpool has not been imported correctly. Make sure armbianEnv.txt contains the correct 'extraargs' to boot from the zpool dataset
```
zpool import rpool
mount -t zfs rpool/BOOT\debian-1 /root
exit
```
Manual booting from the SD card
```
mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /root #sometimes /dev/mmcblk0p1
exit
```

### Missing Kernel headers for custom kernel
Kernel headers are needed for compiling the ZFS module during apt install zfs-dkms.
Use compile options 
```
./compile.sh INSTALL_HEADERS=yes
```
The package file containing the header files can be retrieved from the ./build/output/debs and then installed manually on the NanoPi M4 board.

## Future work
Get u-boot to look for initramfs from raid drive instead of SD card
